# LIOVA

This repository contains a minimal chat-like interface that displays how many tokens are used as you type messages. The token count is an approximation (one token per four characters) and an estimated cost is calculated at $0.002 per 1K tokens.

## Running

Open `src/index.html` in a web browser. Type messages in the text area and press **Send**. The interface keeps track of the total token usage and shows the estimated cost.
